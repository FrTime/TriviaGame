## About the App

#### The app utilizes AJAX calls to find math related questions from an online trivia API.  JQuery is used to dynamically populate the main window with the question as well as a list of the possible answers.  The goal of this app was to allow for new information to passed into the window without the need for refreshing the entire page each time.

## Using the App

#### When the game is started a random question is pulled and the user must select the correct answer from a list of possible choices.  If the user is incorrect then they are briefly shown the correct answer before moving on to the next question.  After a total of 10 questions the game will end and the user is shown their final score out of 10, with the option to start a new game
